# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my AI & ML Internship. The goal was to perform EDA on the Titanic dataset using statistics and visualizations.

## 🔍 Steps Performed

- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset.
- Generated descriptive statistics (mean, std, median, etc.).
- Created visualizations:
  - Histograms and boxplots for numeric features.
  - Countplots for categorical features like `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Embarked`.
  - Pairplot and heatmap to analyze feature relationships.
- Identified trends and patterns that affect survival.

## 🧠 Insights

- Females had higher survival rate than males.
- Passengers in 1st class had a better chance of survival.
- Some columns like `Fare` and `Age` have outliers.
- Strong correlation between `Pclass` and `Fare`.

## 📁 Files

- `Titanic-Dataset.csv` – Original dataset.
- `Internship(Task_2).ipynb` – Code for EDA.
- `README.md` – Summary of analysis and findings.

## 📊 Libraries Used
